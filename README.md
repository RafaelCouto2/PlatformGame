That's a little confused to me for while, but i`m very excited to learn more about gaming creation with all those logics like loops inside threads, tick time, frames, etc... 😵 🤯 <br>
Learning about gaming development will be helpfully to me cuz i`ll understand more about threads, creating a window in Java manually (Without frameworks, etc...), better logics, and more! 🧠 🤓 🤓 <br>
Idk if i`ll be a pro on this, i`m not a game dev in fact BUT surely it'll help me with development in general. 🤔🤔🤔🤔 <br>
