# PLATFORM GAME
<row>
<h1>This is a simple platform gaming. I'm a newbie &#x1F476 on Gaming dev things, but i'm trying to understand more. &#x1F680 &#x1F680 </h1>
<p>! Sprites / Resources by Kaaring Gaming. [He's github](https://github.com/KaarinGaming) ! &#x1F604 </p>

That's a little confused to me for while, but i'm very excited to learn more about gaming creation with all those logics like loops inside threads, tick time, frames, etc...
Learning about gaming development will be helpfully to me cuz i'll understand more about threads, creating an window in Java manually (Without frameworks, etc...), better logics, and more! &#x1F913 &#x1F913
Idk if i'll be a pro on this, i'm not a game dev in fact BUT surely it'll help me with development in general. &#x1F914 &#x1F914 &#x1F914 &#x1F914
